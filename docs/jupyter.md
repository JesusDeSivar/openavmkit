# Using the Jupyter Notebooks

Make sure that you've already installed the `jupyter` library. If not, see [Quick Start](quick_start.md) for instructions.

The `notebooks/` directory contains several pre-written Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the library interactively. These notebooks are especially useful for new users, as they contain step-by-step explanations and examples.

## 1. Launch the Jupyter notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter interface.
